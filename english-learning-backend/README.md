## About this project

### ðŸ’¾Database Schema Documentation
This schema was designed as part of an English learning backend project, with the goal of supporting memorization-based language acquisition. While the current version includes vocabulary-related entities, we are actively developing features to assist with memorizing English news scripts (e.g., from CNN) and studying through YouTube videos.

The database is normalized to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity, with careful attention to scalability, indexing, and strict constraint definitions. If you would like to leave a comment or suggestion, feel free to do so via the link below.
